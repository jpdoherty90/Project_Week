# TixPix

  This was a project I built with two of my Coding Dojo friends, Alyssa Nickow and Julian Auza. The goal was to build a ticket
sharing web app with similar functionality as StubHub.com. It was a one-week sprint and e built the project with in Python with
Django and with SQLite for the database.  

  I built a geolocation finder so that when a user logs in or creates and account, we get their zipcode.  That zipcode then 
gets concatenated into an API that Alyssa built.  The API call is the the SeatGeek API which returns a list of all the evernts
(concerts, plays, sports games, etc.) near the user.  Clicking on an event brings the user to that event page.  From their, my
main contrbution was making the buying and selling routes, allowing user to post tickts for events and buy tickets for events.
Julian built the checkout/payment functionality as well as most of the CSS/styling for the project.  Alyssa built the
aforementioned API call as well as much of the models and validations.

  This was our first group project and first web app that took more than a day or two.  It has been over 3 months since we
completed this project. Since then I have been learning and will continue to learn about OOP, design patterns, and best 
practices, and I'm sure if I were to refactor this project in a few months there will be a lot of changes to be made. That
is in the nature of learning and getting better.
